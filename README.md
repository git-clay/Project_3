# Project_3
SEAN stack travel app

#### [Heroku App](https://protected-hamlet-38916.herokuapp.com/)

#### [Wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-clay/Project_3/master/Wireframes/wireframes.png)

Basically a simplified tripadvisor using their api for travel information and google's api to search for activities.
User's can login and save custom trips to their profile. 

We wanted to step away from the conventional idea of planning a trip. Instead of meandering around trourist traps we wanted to create a way to visit the places the locals still enjoy because these spots are true gems!
