# Project_3
SEAN stack travel app

#### [Heroku App](https://protected-hamlet-38916.herokuapp.com/)
#### [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/g2CM30fa/project-3-travel)
#### [Wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-clay/Project_3/master/Wireframes/wireframes.png)

Basically a simplified tripadvisor using their api for travel information and google's api to search for activities.
User's can login and save custom trips to their profile. 

-Landing page: A world map. Click a region to zoom into the USA then click on Cali for example. 

-Page 2: Then you pick city or adventure on the next screen.  

-Page 3: Display suggestions/ideas that can be re-searched if the results are not adequate.  



Stretch would be to add the social aspect of “travel like a local” (add trips that can be voted up or down)


You both can edit this readme with your ideas that you would like to add or change.
